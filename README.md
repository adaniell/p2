## Description
An xkcd Password Generator, with the purpose of creating a password phrase using random common English words. 

## Demo
Please view screencast here:[http://screencast.com/t/NXo6Mvew0](http://screencast.com/t/NXo6Mvew0) 
> I apologize for getting my demo in so late. I wanted to come to the section tonight to do a live one, but something came up at work and I'm not sure what time I'll be able to leave. 
I will definitely have my demo submitted with P3 & P4, even if I do plan on attending the section after. 

## Details for teaching team
I referenced these pages to get an idea of xkcd definition:

I'm having trouble getting my array of words not to repeat. I tried using both shuffle and the rand function but get the same results every time.

No outside code.
